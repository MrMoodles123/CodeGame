An educational game built with the Godot engine that aims to teach programming concepts (loops, arrays, etc.) through fun farming activities. Players learn by completing tutorials that introduce coding alongside gameplay mechanics like breaking rocks and harvesting crops. The game also features randomly generated challenge levels with leaderboards to encourage competitive coding and efficient problem-solving.

## How To Play
 
To run the game use the provided .exe file - Capstone.exe. 	On launch you will be presented with the home screen with a few options:

- The “TUTORIAL” Button takes you to the tutorial of the game. Here is where Misty will teach you how to farm and play the game. You will be greeted with a screen to choose the level of the tutorial. At first, only level 1 will be unlocked. The rest will be unlocked as you finish them.
- The “CHALLENGES” Button takes you to the main game, where the aim is to beat all farms with the lowest score. There are 5 levels. All levels will be locked until you complete the tutorial. Once you have, level 1 will unlock. Each subsequent level will unlock when you complete the previous one.
- The “LEADERBOARD” Button shows the global leaderboards for each challenge level. To access it, you need to sign up.
- The “PROFILE” Button is where you can view your profile and your best scores for your levels. If you have not created a profile. It will prompt you to create one before you can view your profile.
